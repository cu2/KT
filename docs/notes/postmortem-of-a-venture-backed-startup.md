## The Search For Product/Market Fit

“Make something people want.” — Paul Graham

“I would use your product if only you had X feature” is a dangerous signal to follow. Users do their best to anticipate what they want before they’ve seen it but, like entrepreneurs, they are often wrong.
Enterprise companies should validate demand by asking customers to put their money where their mouths are. Media and social networking companies should double down on analytics to find, observe, and build for actual user behavior.

Mistake. People didn’t like the bland “@Sonar” text string so they stopped sharing updates from Sonar. Their friends never engaged with our updates in the first place. Facebook noticed this and started hiding our posts. Instead of optimizing for actual user behavior, we spent countless whiteboarding sessions trying in vain to design an alternative.

Removing friction from existing user behaviors (e.g. checkins) almost always has a higher ROI than building castles in the sky (e.g. hypothesizing about your API). Find all the dead ends/local maxima in your current products before building new ones!

One mistake I personally have fallen victim to repeatedly is thinking that iteration = small choices.  That’s not true at all.  The feature/improvement you choose to iterate on in your product should be the one that will be most impactful in pushing you closer to your big goal. If your hypothesis of the impact from iteration feels small then either A) you’re iterating on the wrong thing or B) it might be time for another big swing.


## Things I Wish I Spent Less Time On

“Focus is saying no to 1,000 good ideas.” — Steve Jobs

You do not have 20% time. Identify your top three priorities. Throw away numbers two and three.

Be steady at the wheel. The only way one startup can kill another startup is by getting into the other’s head and leading them off a cliff.
If you don’t believe me, try this proof. Are your competitors releasing a bunch of the same features that you have on your roadmap? Yes? Do you know what consumers want*? No? Great, then neither do your competitors. Get back to figuring out what users want!
*Hint: If you did, you would already have traction.

As John Burroughs said, “A man can fail many times, but he isn’t a failure until he begins to blame somebody else.” Avoid bad relationships like the plague but when you inevitably find yourself in a difficult partnership, don’t waste precious energy wailing against it. Make it work or move on quickly.


## It’s All About People
“The essence of competitiveness is liberated when we make people believe that what they think and do is important – and then get out of their way while they do it.” — Jack Welch


## Onward
“What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.” — Rainer Maria Rilke via Tim O’Reilly
