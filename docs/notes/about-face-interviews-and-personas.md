# About Face - Interviews and personas

Based on [About Face 3: The Essentials of Interaction Design](http://www.amazon.com/About-Face-Essentials-Interaction-Design/dp/0470084111)

Their goals in purchasing the product

- Their frustrations with current solutions
- Their decision process for purchasing a product of the type you’re designing
- Their role in installation, maintenance, and management of the product
- Domain-related issues and vocabulary

If you are redesigning or refining an existing product, it is important to speak to both current and potential users,
that is, people who do not currently use the product but who are good candidates for using it in the future
because they have needs that can be met with the product and are in the target market for the product.


- The context of how the product (or analogous system, if no current product exists) fits into their lives or workflow: when, why, and how the product is or will be used
- Domain knowledge from a user perspective: What do users need to know to do their jobs?
- Current tasks and activities: both those the current product is required to accomplish and those it doesn’t support
- Goals and motivations for using their product
- Mental model: how users think about their jobs and activities, as well as what expectations users have about the product
- Problems and frustrations with current products (or an analogous system if no current product exists)



- Interview where the interaction happens
- Avoid a fixed set of questions
- Focus on goals first, tasks second
- Avoid making the user a designer
- Avoid discussions of technology
- Encourage storytelling
- Ask for a show and tell
- Avoid leading questions



Here are some goal-oriented questions to consider:

- Goals — What makes a good day? A bad day?
- Opportunity — What activities currently waste your time?
- Priorities — What is most important to you?
- Information — What helps you make decisions?

Another useful type of question is the system-oriented question:

- Function — What are the most common things you do with the product?
- Frequency — What parts of the product do you use most?
- Preference — What are your favorite aspects of the product? What drives you crazy?
- Failure — How do you work around problems?
- Expertise — What shortcuts do you employ?

For business products, workflow-oriented questions can be helpful:

- Process — What did you do when you first came in today? And after that?
- Occurrence and recurrence — How often do you do this? What things do you do weekly or monthly, but not every day?
- Exception — What constitutes a typical day? What would be an unusual event?

To better understand user motivations, you can employ attitude-oriented questions:

- Aspiration — What do you see yourself doing five years from now?
- Avoidance — What would you prefer not to do? What do you procrastinate on?
- Motivation — What do you enjoy most about your job (or lifestyle)? What do you always tackle first?





persona = roles + needs + behaviours + expertise + motivations (why) + goals

- personification
- empathy
- cognitive and emotional dimensions

- experience goals: how a user wants to feel
- end goals: what a user wants to do
- life goals: who a user wants to be

1. Identify behavioral variables.
    - Activities — What the user does; frequency and volume
    - Attitudes — How the user thinks about the product domain and technology
    - Aptitudes — What education and training the user has; capability to learn
    - Motivations — Why the user is engaged in the product domain
    - Skills — User capabilities related to the product domain and technology
2. Map interview subjects to behavioral variables.
    - put each user on each scale
    - e.g. userX is is 10% "necessity only" and 90% "entertainment"
3. Identify significant behavior patterns.
4. Synthesize characteristics and relevant goals.
5. Check for redundancy and completeness.
6. Expand description of attributes and behaviors.
7. Designate persona types.
    - Primary: the primary target for the design of an interface
    - Secondary
    - Supplemental
    - Customer
    - Served
    - Negative
