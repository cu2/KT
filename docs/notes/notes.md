## UX

### UX advice from Juli

- competition analysis:
    - check out features
    - and reasons why people might use them
    - what's my "offer", what do users get from KT vs other alternatives?

- interviews:
    - ask in details about last 2 weeks
    - what did they watch?
    - how and why did they choose them?
    - ask a continuous story, not just yes/no or numeric questions

- stories, use cases, personas:
    - story: bunch of functions, smaller use cases in a flow
    - use cases: not just functionality, but emotions (e.g. I'm so thrilled to find this film from my childhood)
    - persona: kind of a role, e.g. non-KT-user FB friend of a KT-user (sees his KT shares)

- survey:
    - have potential use cases before the survey
    - ask about them specifically, and not just without any preconceptions and frames
    - leave a free text area as well (for getting special cases)

- UX + design is an iteration in an ideal case: a good designer gives feedbacks about the wireframe

- reading:
    - iterate it with work
    - when you work on a topic, read about it; then go on
    - Pepe sent some notes on books

- old users:
    - let them complain about changes, it helps them to bear these
    - give them help when changing things, e.g. tooltips and messages that show them around on the new site

- how to create a mobile web page that is really smooth and native-like?

Mobile first approach:

- it's not about users on the move, only limited screen size
- have all the info that the web version has
- only tap and scroll more to get them
- it helps prioritizing and choosing MVP features
- load fast first, then get the rest via ajax
