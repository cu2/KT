## Leni the up-and-coming

She spends a lot of time watching films and reading about them. She's omnivorous, open minded and very eager to learn. She likes talking with people knowledgeable in different genres, like Jean-Luc (whom she admires), Quentin or Susanne. She likes various toplists of films and directors or other recommendations that help her widening her knowledge. She tracks the films she saw, probably would like to collect badges.


## Jean-Luc the intellectual

He's interested in certain genres and periods, like the French new wave, film noir, classic Hollywood movies from the 50s when even shallow comedies were deep, John Wayne. He likes to talk with the *right* people (mostly other Jean-Lucs): comparing Godard to Fassbinder (definitely not with Steven who thinks Fassbinder is Fassbender), discussing the age difference between Audrey Hepburn and her male film partners, and getting upset by the remakes of classic films and genres. He likes teaching Leni who seems to have the potential to become Jean-Luc, even though she's too open towards Quentin and Susanne. Once in a while he organizes filmclubs.


## Quentin the geek

He's very into specific genres and subgenres, like horror, slash, gore, giallo, trash, scifi, cyberpunk, steampunk. Since he's already seen the basics of these genres, he's searching for not so well known films in special databases, forums, blogs, lists. He usually talks with other Quentins, but sometimes with Leni, Susanne and occasionally even Christopher. He takes pride in tracking how many film he's seen per subgenre.


## Susanne the social

Most of the time she watches indie and/or European films. She goes to festivals, thematic days, filmclubs. Sometimes even organizes them. She reads a lot of interviews and news about films, directors, actors. She's very active on the social media, following the lastest and freshest news, and sharing her experiences with other Susannes.


## Christopher the fanboy

He's all about upcoming films from his favorite directors, even if the film's premier is next year. Trailers, posters, news flashes, tidbits, anything he can get his hands on. He's very enthusiastic, very talkative when it comes to the object of his interest (mostly with other Christophers, but occasionally Leni, Quentin or Susanne).


## Steven the layman

He's the least knowledgeable of all the personas, but likes to watch films regularly nonetheless. Usually the latest movies from Hollywood, but unlike Christopher he's not interested in the background, just the film. Since he has not much idea about genres or directors, he likes browsing around, watching trailers and pictures, reading plots, choosing by mood, popularity and cinema program. Once in a while he just asks his Facebook friends to recommend him something for Friday night. He's not really interested in tracking, rating or commenting the films, maybe just sharing them on Facebook.
