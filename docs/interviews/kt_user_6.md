## Watching films

- What have you seen lately? In the last week/month?
    - Andrej Rubljov
    - The Last Temptation of Christ
    - Star Wars all (in Machete order)
    - Harry Potter all
- What kind of films you watch?
    - sometimes simple films like action, comedy, animation, Marvel, X-men
    - sometimes more serious stuff like Dogma/Scandinavian, classics
    - favourite: Dogville, Lars von Trier, 8 1/2, Fellini, 12 Monkeys, Bruce Willis
    - you like: Scandinavian, scifi, anything about the cold war (or alternative history) e.g. The Watchmen
    - you hate: horror, most thrillers, Scorsese is not my type (irritating characters), Hungarian "popular" films eg Sas Tamas, Terezanyu
- Why do you like them?
    - entertainment: I'm tired after work, try to relax but my brain is still too active: Austin Powers
    - escaping reality:
        - identifying with "heroes": Hunger Games, Harry Potter
    - intellectual:
        - meaning of life and stuff: 8 1/2, Andrej Rubljov
        - social/political topics: The Watchmen
    - emotional:
        - love (both romantic and friendship/family): Despicable Me, Saving Mr Banks, After Wedding
        - unjustice and "revenge": Kick/Ass
    - I think it's partly a habit, the remains of my earlier identity (see below at film clubs and festivals)
    - Art is a good way of coping with life (eg how people in books, films handle hard situations), and from all the art forms film is the easiest (and maybe fastest) for me to understand. Second is literature I guess, but it requires even more time and I don't even have time for films. Music is great for abstract, emotional stuff, but something more "concrete" is missing.
- How do you choose films you watch?
    - mood: eg when I'm tired I usually go for something lightweight
    - plot, pictures, ratings and recommendations (KT and some friends), director, actors
    - snobbery: films I know I should have already seen; but only if they probably fit my taste
    - I almost always use KT for finding films
    - very rarely I bump into sth interesting elsewhere, eg 444 -> geekz
    - recommendations: I try to rely on people who have a similar taste
- When, where, how and with whom do you watch them?
    - mostly download, watch at home alone or with partner
    - I like "reliving" the films I really like by watching best parts of it (that's why I download and not stream) or reading quotes
    - very rarely cinema:
        - if there's no-one around, the big screen makes it easier to get engaged
        - if there are a lot of people, it's mostly annoying
    - used to go to film festivals and thematic days, but the crowd really annoys me, so I'm not even attracted anymore
- How often and how much time do you spend on?
    - not as much as I would prefer, about 1-2/week
- How much money do you spend on? For what?
    - cinema: 0.5/month, so about 1000/month
    - dvd: used to, but not anymore
    - books: no

    - otherwise: more than the average, less than people on KT

    - download: cca 200
    - dvd: cca 100
- Why do/did you collect them?
    - download:
        - I like rewatching films and scenes so I like to keep them
        - films w subs: it's not that easy to find the matching sub, so if I once managed to do it, I don't want to lose it
    - dvd:
        - I used to buy dvds, when this whole film watching thing was part of my identity, spending money on it and owning in a physical format was a good way to strengthen this
        - and downloading wasn't that easy 10 years ago as today
- How do you keep track of them?
    - I had an excel film, but not anymore
    - If KT had this feature I think I would use it, but the same is true for this as for the wishlist: there has to be some feature to match it against mood and recommendations


## Only for KT users

- How often do you use KT? daily
- When did you use KT last time? today
- What for? Why? How?
    - checking latest comments
    - because I like to know what's going on

- How would you summarize KT in one sentence? Film portal, database, community.
- List 3 things you love most about KT
    - database: it has almost everything I (would ever) need
    - search and explore: it's like wikipedia in the film domain, you just click and click and never get bored
    - community: lot of people with lot of knowledge and/or experience
- List 3 things you hate most about KT
    - slow: sometimes just a bit, sometimes very much, it ruins the experience
    - it could be so much greater with good recommendation and better ui
    - Some comments make me irritated. Usually I try to avoid comments on the internet, because I know I can't handle them well, but on KT it's part of the reason I'm there. Maybe I have to improve and not KT. :-)


## Retro

- Is there anything else you would like to add?
