# UX plan


## Personas and use cases

Purpose: to answer these questions:

- who and how uses/could use KT?
- what values KT provides for and what emotions it generates in users?

Method: create personas and use cases

- persona should be a human, not just a set of properties
- use case should be a story/part of a story, not just a set of features

The more preconceptions you have for the interviews and/or survey, the more info you'll get. But the more you'll get, the more and better preconceptions you'll get. So iterate.

- First version of personas and use cases
    - personas: I had none
    - [use cases](use_cases_v1.md)
- Interviews (see [here](interviews/))
    - what to ask? see [Questions for exploring personas and use cases](persona_interview_questions.md)
    - Skype? Hangouts? live? email?
        - email: it's easy to do, but hard to interpret (you can't ask back a lot of times) and control (the subject can easily misunderstand what you asked, and you can't correct her on the spot)
        - live: it can be scary and frustrating (if you have social skill issues), but you can get more out of it, especially if you're able to jump between the questions
    - notes? record it?
        - probably it's easier to let the conversation flow, if you don't have to take notes, just record it (but I never tried)
    - who to ask?
        - KT users
            - lot of comments and votes
            - lot of votes, few comments
            - lot of comments, few votes
            - just listens
            - ex active user
        - new users
            - friends, family, colleagues
            - relevant FB groups
- Second version of personas and use cases
    - [personas](personas_v2.md)
    - [use cases](use_cases_v2.md)
- Survey
    - only questions that yield answers I can learn from
    - only questions that yield answers that help building a better KT
    - predefined choices where possible: [Likert scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale)
    - for KT users
        - who to ask?
            - everyone?
        - what to ask?
    - for new users
        - who to ask?
            - friends, family, colleagues
            - relevant FB groups
        - what to ask?
- Third version of personas and use cases
    - personas
    - use cases
